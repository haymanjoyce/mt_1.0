"""
This is a Python application for creating Gantt charts.
It is meant for professional project planners to use.
Planners are asked, routinely, to produce detailed and engaging "Plans on a Page (POAP)" for project managers.
This tool addresses this need.
It generates vector graphics from data (there is no hand drawing involved).
Users interact with the tool via a Command Line Interface (CLI).
