So features we want...

Data handling...
Save to CSV, Excel, JSON, or Pickle (.pkl) (so any/all data can represented as any of these)
Export named tables (format data only, chart data only, all) (default CSV), all tables (default Excel), chart settings (default JSON), tool settings (if different) (default JSON), everything (default .pkl)
Load/merge the data back in after user has edited, added, deleted content
Use Pandas Dataframes to hold data in memory (and not dict of dicts) because Pandas come with lots of this functionality built in and functionality for interacting with data via CLI

Checking data...
Check imported data makes sense and reject it if not (try, except)
This can be an option on loading back in or a standalone command

Generating SVG...
Next we want to process the data - turn it into SVG
Going to use drawsvg2 for this - covered in project journal
Drawsvg2 also supports, with Cairo, outputs in all kinds of format
So we want a command, with options, for generating the chart from the available data
Need to think about most efficient way of doing this - can we read data straight from df or do we need to create dataclass/attrs objects to hold it before conversion to SVG?
We also need to turn time into pixels and create scales; Pandas has support for creating data increments
Do we prep all the data in the dataframe first or do the conversions in, for example, shape classes?
Inclined to do everything in the dataframes first - so we take the human readable data and turn it into arbitrary units which we then convert to pixels at required scale
This is clean and means we, in essence, compile in dataframes, then generate svg with min processing - good for animation if we need it

Saving chart...
We want a command for "printing" or saving the chart, with options
One of those options could be, at some point, a web page, by the way - with data loaded so it is dynamic
We could also build a QtSVG viewer into the app in case user doesn't have a browser/app with which to view the SVG
