So features we want...

Save to CSV, Excel, JSON, or Pickle (.pkl) (so any/all data can represented as any of these)
Export named tables (default CSV), all tables (default Excel), chart settings (default JSON), tool settings (if different) (default JSON), everything (default .pkl)
Load/merge the data back in after user has edited, added, deleted content
Check imported data makes sense and reject it if not (try, except)
[Use Pandas Dataframes to hold data in memory (and not dict of dicts) because Pandas come with lots of this functionality built in and functionality for interacting with data via CLI]

Next...

Next we want to process the data - turn it into SVG
