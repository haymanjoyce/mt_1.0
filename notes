How do we input and output data with a CLI?

So the user (he) pulls the tables (CSV) from tool
He then edits the table (in text editor or spreadsheet)
He and add, update, delete rows
Then he imports the table back in
(We can make it easier by adding option to export them all at same time, and to Excel, and opening the spreadsheet)
Then the tool does some checks on the imported data
Then it parses it to JSON (this means all the data for a chart can be saved in one JSON file) (use Pandas)
Then the user can generate the SVG (and then other formats) from the JSON held in memory
Or he can save the JSON to a file to store persistently

Settings data for a chart or config data for a tool is not really tabular
In both cases, we could export as JSON or text file
I think we export as JSON but, typically, the user will change settings via the interface, one at a time

Users can also view tables and other data on the interface but no suitable for editing data
